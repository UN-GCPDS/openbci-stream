    "In order to get all up to date, it is a requirement to have the firmwares fully updated, this issue is handled by Arduino IDE, a preconfigured files for set up the system can be installed with:\n",

    "hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/gcpds/arduino\n",

    "## Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "  * OpenBCI 32bit Library 3.1.1\n",
    "  * OpenBCI 32bit SD 2.0.0\n",
    "  * OpenBCI Wifi Master 1.0.1\n",
    "  * OpenBCI Radios 2.0.4\n",
    "  \n",

    "## Boards\n",
    "\n",
    "  * RFDuino 2.3.3\n",
    "  * ChipKIT 2.0.6\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "After this *Arduino IDE* must be able to use boards like `OpenBCI 32` and `RFduino`, new examples will be created too, the most important are `OpenBCI_Radios >> RadioHost32bit`, `OpenBCI_Radios >> RadioDevice32bit` and `OpenBCI_32bit_Library >> DefaultBoard`.\n",

    "### OpenBCI 32bit (Cyton)\n",
    "This is the `ChipKIT` based board, can be programmed through RFduino, just like when we are using the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/32bit_top.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Select the board `OpenBCI 32`\n",
    "  * Load `OpenBCI_32bit_Library >> DefaultBoard` from examples\n",
    "  * Put board in *bootloader mode* pressing `PRG` and `RST` button and releasing first `PRG` and then `RST`.\n",
    "  * `Verify` and `Upload` with Arduino IDE.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### RFduino Host\n",
    "This is the board tha we connect through USB, is **IMPORTANT** set the switch to `RESET` position.\n",

    "  \n",
    "### RFduino Device\n",
    "This board is beside `ChipKIT`, but no have an own serial connection, so is needed an external `FTDI device`, is very **IMPORTANT** to use a 3V device instead of 5V and power the Cyton board with this source and not with batteries.  \n",

    "Both classes allow the board initialization, stream, and data acquisition, `Cyton` can be used in synchronous and asynchronous implementations, is more flexible and the recommended way to handle boards, on the other hand,  `OpenBCIConsumer` is an implementation based in controlled execution, must be used when access immediately to the EEG data is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which should I choose?\n",
    "Most of the time the `Cyton` class is the best option, it supports overwriting, and can be used to start and stop de acquisition at any time without disconnect the board. `OpenBCIConsumer` is recommended for a real-time data consumer or for markers listening.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distributed stream access\n",
    "If a data stream is currently active (it can be created via `Cython` or `OpenBCIConsumer`) is possible to use `OpenBCIConsumer` to only access the data streamed, in this way is possible to get multiple real-time scripts for data processing."
